## HOW THE BOUNTY IS INTEGRATED

- Particle Network : We're utilizing particle connect as WaaS in the project, making the onboarding process of the user
  much more easier since it's also supporting web2 OAuth such as from Google, X, Github and many more throught it's
  account abstraction feature.

- Klaster SDK: By utilizing Klaster SDK combined with Particle Connect, we're enabling the user to have the ability
  using a unified balanced of an ERC20 token. In this project we're using Native balance (ETH) & stable coin (USDC) as
  the currency to do a transaction.
